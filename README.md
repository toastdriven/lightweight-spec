# Lightweight Spec

A frequent part of new projects, especially large or complex ones, is to throw
together a lightweight spec. Since I always end up manually re-creating it,
this is a stubbed/templated version.


## Why?

Full waterfall is painful & can require weeks/months of planning. By the time
that's complete, the requirements may have changed (or worse, no longer be
needed).

On the flip side, full agile moves fast, but can end up with a lot of rework
as more of the process/implementation comes into focus. It can also be unclear
as to why things were done a certain way.

Lightweight specs force you to think about the implementation up-front, design
a cohesive solution, expose shortcomings early. At the same time, they should
be quick to write, changed as the requirements change, & non-exhaustive to
avoid rabbit-holing during the planning stage.

It's your chance to think & get ahead of flaws/challenges early.
